            James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company,
             so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.</p>

            <h2>SHOPPING HARD OR HARDLY SHOPPING REVEALING CONSUMER SEGMENTS USING CLICK STREAM DATA.</h2>
            <p>The recent rise of big data analytics is transforming the apparel retailing industry. 
                E-retailers, for example, effectively use large volumes of data generated as a result of their day-to-day business operations data to aid operations and supply chain management.
                 Although logs of how consumers navigate through an e-commerce website are readily available in a form of clickstream data, clickstream analysis is rarely used to derive insights that can support marketing decisions,
                 leaving it an under-researched area of study. </p>
